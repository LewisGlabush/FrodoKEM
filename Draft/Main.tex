% IACR Communications in Cryptology template file
% This file shows how to use the iacrcc class to write a paper.

%% Document mode
% [version=xxx] where xxx is preprint, submission, or final. The default is preprint.
%               version=submission puts line numbers into the document and makes it
%               anonymous (which can be overridden).
%               version=final is for submitting the final version. This requires a license
%               to be specified and must be compiled with lualatex.
% [notanonymous]  Keep author names in submission mode
%% Package options
% [floatrow]      Load floatrow package with correct captions
% [biblatex]      Use the biblatex package instead of bibtex. Note that options
%                 may not be passed to biblatex at this time.

% Uncomment the next line if you have TeX Live 2021 or later

% and control the following:
% inst:     a numerical list pointing to the index of the institution 
%           in the affiliation array.

%           linking to the authors ORCID iD see: orcid.org.
% footnote: create an author-specific footnote.
% onclick:  define what to do when clicking on the external link logo

  Large-scale quantum computers capable of implementing Shor's algorithm pose a significant threat to the security of the most widely used public-key cryptographic schemes.
  This risk has motivated substantial efforts by standards bodies and government agencies to identify and standardize quantum-safe cryptographic systems.
  Among the proposed solutions, lattice-based cryptography has emerged as the foundation for some of the most promising protocols.

  This paper describes \FrodoKEM, a family of conservative key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) whose security is based on generic, “unstructured” lattices.
  \FrodoKEM is proposed as an alternative to the more efficient lattice schemes that utilize \emph{algebraically structured} lattices, such as the recently standardized ML-KEM scheme.
  By relying on generic lattices, \FrodoKEM minimizes the potential for future attacks that exploit algebraic structures while enabling simpler and more compact implementations.
  Our plain C implementations demonstrate that, despite its conservative design and parameterization, \FrodoKEM remains practical.
  For instance, the full protocol at NIST security level 1 runs in approximately 0.97~ms on a server-class processor, and 4.98~ms on a smartphone-class processor.

%The original version of FrodoKEM met it's security goal of single target IND-CCA security when submitted to the 2021 NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization project. However, there were concerns about security degradation when many keys would be generated for a single user. This turned out to be a generic problem for any KEM, built from the Fujisaki--Okamoto transform, that had a small message length. FrodoKEM now utilizes a new tool called the salted Fujisaki--Okamoto ($\SFO$) transform, which mitigates multi-challenge security degradation, without increasing the message length, and having a very small impact on performance. 

  \FrodoKEM obtains (single-target) \INDCCA security using a variant of the Fujisaki--Okamoto transform, applied to an underlying public-key encryption scheme called \FrodoPKE.\@
  In addition, using a new tool called the Salted Fujisaki--Okamoto ($\SFO$) transform, \FrodoKEM is also shown to \emph{tightly} achieve \emph{multi-challenge} security, without increasing the \FrodoPKE message length and with a negligible performance impact, based on the multi-challenge $\INDCPA$ security of \FrodoPKE.
