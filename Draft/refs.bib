abstract = {This paper gives polynomial time quantum algorithms for computing the ideal class group (CGP) under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis and solving the principal ideal problem (PIP) in number fields of arbitrary degree. These are are fundamental problems in number theory and they are connected to many unproven conjectures in both analytic and algebraic number theory. Previously the best known algorithms by Hallgren [20] only allowed to solve these problems in quantum polynomial time for number fields of constant degree. In a recent breakthrough, Eisentr\"{a}ger et al. [11] showed how to compute the unit group in arbitrary fields, thus opening the way to the resolution of CGP and PIP in the general case. For example, Biasse and Song [3] pointed out how to directly apply this result to solve PIP in classes of cyclotomic fields of arbitrary degree.The methods we introduce in this paper run in quantum polynomial time in arbitrary classes of number fields. They can be applied to solve other problems in computational number theory as well including computing the ray class group and solving relative norm equations. They are also useful for ongoing cryptanalysis of cryptographic schemes based on ideal lattices [5, 10].Our algorithms generalize the quantum algorithm for computing the (ordinary) unit group [11]. We first show that CGP and PIP reduce naturally to the computation of S-unit groups, which is another fundamental problem in number theory. Then we show an efficient quantum reduction from computing S-units to the continuous hidden subgroup problem introduced in [11]. This step is our main technical contribution, which involves careful analysis of the metrical properties of lattices to prove the correctness of the reduction. In addition, we show how to convert the output into an exact compact representation, which is convenient for further algebraic manipulations.},

  abstract="In this chapter we describe some of the recent progress in lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here. Another useful resource is the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser [49], which also contains a wealth of information on the computational complexity aspects of lattice problems.",
